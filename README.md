# Finserve 💸

A backend service for handling core financial operations such as user accounts, transaction management, and payment tracking — built using **Node.js, Express, and MySQL**.

This project serves as a foundational API layer for fintech-style applications, inspired by real-world development experience in building monetary transaction systems at Bryzos and e-commerce platforms with multiple payment gateways.

> Designed to be simple, modular, and easy to extend for small-to-medium scale financial logic.
